            <p>I had a very normal morning. I stayed in bed for about an hour, then got up and took a shower.
                Here's what I ate for breakfast/lunch:
                <ul>
                    <li>Instant ramen</li>
                    <li>Water</li>
                    <li>Banana</li>
                </ul>
                It was a very boring morning.
            </p>
                <!-- Inside of your paragraph, create an unordered list of everything that you ate for breakfast -->

        <section id="afternoon">

            <!-- Make a second-level header with the text "My Afternoon" -->
            <h2>My Afternoon</h2>

            <!-- Use a blockquote element to write a short paragraph about your afternoon. Make sure to emphasize certain words. -->
            <blockquote>In the afternoon, I sat at the dining table in the <em>sun</em> and started reading
